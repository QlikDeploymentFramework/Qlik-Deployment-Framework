The new editor is a very powerful tool. We can now graphically create Global Variables in each container.
But also Container Global Variable that will be stored in the Shared Folder.
The Variable Editor also have a Container Map editor so that container creation and maintenance is even easier.

And Container base Variables will be loaded based on ContainerMap.csv

New SUB file 4.LoadContainerGlobalVariables.qvs contain procedure to dynamically load Global Variables connecting to other container
call LoadContainerGlobalVariables('Name of Container to load', 'Optional use Container map from Shared Folder');
