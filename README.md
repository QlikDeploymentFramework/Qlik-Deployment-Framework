# Qlik-Deployment-Framework (QDF)

Resource Sharing, Reuse, Organization, Structure and Standards providing an effective and efficient Qlik deployment.

## Qlik Deployment Framework resource containers
QDF is based on a resource container architecture. Arrange containers (building blocks and security separators) to fit the current needs, when demand changes its easy to reorganize and add additional containers. QlikView and/or Qlik Sense applications are hooked into the containers in which all needed resources reside.
